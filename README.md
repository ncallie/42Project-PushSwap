# 42Project-PushSwap
<p align=center>
	This project's goal is to make the student get in contact with the idea of sorting algorithms and complexity. In possession of a list of numbers, the program must be able to use only two stacks and a restricted number of movements in order to sort the list out.

### Rules

You have 2 stacks named `A` and `B`. 
- The `stack A` contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated. 
- The `stack B` is empty. 

The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into `stack A`.
To do so you have the following operations at your disposal: 

- `sa` (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of `stack A`. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. 
- `sb` (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of `stack B`. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. 
- `ss` : `sa` and `sb` at the same time. 
- `pa` (push a): Take the first element at the top of `B` and put it at the top of `A`. Do nothing if `B` is empty. 
- `pb` (push b): Take the first element at the top of `A` and put it at the top of `B`. Do nothing if `A` is empty.  
- `ra` (rotate a): Shift up all elements of `stack A` by 1. The first element becomes the last one. 
- `rb` (rotate b): Shift up all elements of `stack B` by 1. The first element becomes the last one.  
- `rr`: `ra` and `rb` at the same time. 
- `rra` (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of `stack A` by 1. The last element becomes the first one. 
- `rrb` (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of `stack B` by 1. The last element becomes the first one.  
- `rrr`: `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.

You can launch the program by doing
```sh
> $ ./push_swap <list_of_integers> 
```
The list can be passed as a single array of multiple numbers, indiferently. 
```sh
> $ ./push_swap 1 3 5 4 2 0 -4
```
The expected output should be the instructions applied in order to sort the stack: 

```sh
> $ ./push_swap 0 4 2
> pb
> ra
> pa
```
Or an `Error` message in case of errors of any kind:
```sh
> $ ./push_swap 0 4 two
> Error
```

If no parameters are passed, the command prompted will be returned with no error message:
Or an `Error` message in case of errors of any kind:
```sh
> $ ./push_swap
> $
```
